Simulated the customer-facing ticket creation process in osTicket, where an end-user submits a ticket that is routed to the help desk. This process ensures that customer issues are properly logged, categorized, and assigned for resolution.

I also created and managed a high-priority ticket for a mobile/online banking system outage, setting its properties, including SLA and department assignment, while testing access permissions for different roles.

<p>
Had the customer agent reassign the ticket to themselves in osTicket and post a response in the thread, demonstrating proactive communication and ticket ownership. The agent informed the user that they may have found a solution and would follow up, ensuring transparency and engagement in the resolution process.

<p>
Emulated the process of resolving a ticket in osTicket by having the customer agent post a final comment updating the user and marking the ticket as Resolved. The agent communicated the resolution to the customer, ensuring clarity and transparency in the support process. This project demonstrates my ability to manage ticket lifecycles, provide effective customer communication, and finalize IT support resolutions within a help desk environment.
